#miniLock Unit Test Kit

##Instructions
miniLock Unit Test Kit (mUTK) is a set of unit tests that attempt to evaluate miniLock's functional sanity from the user's potential environment.

In order to run mUTK, just open `mUTK.html`.

##Notes
miniLock Unit Test Kit covers miniLock directly, and its dependencies/libraries only indirectly. For the unit tests of the libraries miniLock uses, please visit their respective codebases as listed in `RESOURCES.md`.
